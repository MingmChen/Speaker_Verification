-------------------------
Foreword
-------------------------

The purpose of this project is to provide a package for speech processing and
feature extraction. This library provides most frequent used speech features including MFCCs and filterbank energies alongside with the log-energy of filterbanks.

-------------------------
Motivation
-------------------------

There are different motivations for this open source project.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Deep Learning application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the main reasons for creating this package was to provide necessary features for deep learning applications such as ASR(Automatic Speech Recognition) or SR(Speaker Recognition).
As a results, most of the features that are necessary are provided hear.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pythonic Packaging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another reason for creating this package was to have a Pythonic environment for
speech recognition and feature extraction due to the fact that the Python language
is becoming ubiquotous!
